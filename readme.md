# Considerations

All algorithms will result in ascending order.
n = size of the list to be sorted

# Selection Sort

Simple selection sorting algorithm. The code iterates through the entire list n times looking for the smallest element and putting it at the start.

### Time complexity:  
Best case: O(n^2)
Worst case: O(n^2)
Average case: O(n^2)

# Bubble Sort

The algorithm will iterate through the list swapping adjacent elements so that the smallest one will always be on the left.

### Time complexity:  
Best case: O(n)
Worst case: O(n^2)  
Average case: O(n^2)

# Quick Sort

Quick sorting algorithm based on Joe James' video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB_NCoxzQnk)  
I encourage you to watch his video for a very good explanation about how it works.

### Time complexity:  
Best case: O(n logn)
Worst case: O(n^2)  
Average case: O(n logn)
